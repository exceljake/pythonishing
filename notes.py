### Hello and welcome! 
### I am Jake, and here are my code snippets in learning Python. 

## Print

print("Hello World!")

## Print a variable

x = 5
print(x)

## Printing a variable with arithmetic operators 

x = 10 
y = 5
print(x * y)

## 
x = 0
y = 10

if 0 == x: 
    if y == 10: 
        print("Yes")
